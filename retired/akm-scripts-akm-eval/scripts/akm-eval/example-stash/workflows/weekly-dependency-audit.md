# Weekly Dependency Audit

A short, repeatable workflow for the recurring "is anything dangerous in our
lockfile this week?" question. Run it on a schedule, hand the output to
review, move on. Optimised for *not* drifting into a half-finished migration
or accidentally importing a sketchy postinstall script. Every path below is
relative to the workspace directory named by the `workspace_dir` parameter,
unless stated otherwise.

## prepare-branch

Set up an isolated workspace before touching the lockfile.

1. Confirm the branch named by the `base_branch` parameter is up to date:

   ```sh
   git fetch origin <base_branch>
   git switch -c chore/dep-audit <base_branch>
   ```

   Name the local branch with this workflow run's id as a suffix so repeated
   audits never collide, e.g. `chore/dep-audit-<run-id>`.
2. If the `env` parameter is provided, verify the keys it declares without
   surfacing values:

    ```sh
    akm show <env>
    ```

   Block the run if any key the registry needs is missing.
3. Create `audit-context.md` with the run timestamp, the `package_manager`
   parameter, the `base_branch` HEAD SHA, and the contents of `freeze_list`
   (if any).

### gate

- A clean branch exists from a fresh `base_branch`.
- `env` keys are confirmed present (or `env` was omitted intentionally).
- `audit-context.md` records the starting state for reproducibility.

## inventory

Produce one canonical list of candidates, building on the branch prepared by
`prepare-branch`, attached to this unit as input. Do not start upgrading yet.

1. Load registry credentials only into the shell that runs the audit
   commands, never into agent context:

    ```sh
    akm env run <env> -- bun outdated --json
    ```

    Use `akm env run <env> -- <command>` for each audit command that
    needs registry credentials.

2. Run the commands native to the package manager named by the
   `package_manager` parameter, and capture full output to disk:

   - `bun`: `bun outdated --json` and `bun audit --json`
   - `pnpm`: `pnpm outdated --json` and `pnpm audit --json`
   - `npm`: `npm outdated --json` and `npm audit --json`
   - `yarn`: `yarn outdated --json` and `yarn npm audit --json`

   Save raw output to `outdated.json` and `audit.json`.
3. Build `candidates.md` with one row per package: `name`, `current`,
   `wanted`, `latest`, `severity` (from audit, if any), `direct_dep`
   (yes/no), `notes`. Strip out anything in the `freeze_list` parameter.

### gate

- `outdated.json` and `audit.json` exist with raw tool output.
- `candidates.md` lists every upgrade candidate with version deltas and
  severity.
- Packages in `freeze_list` are excluded from `candidates.md` and the reason
  is recorded.

## classify

Sort candidates into bands so that the safe ones can ship today and the rest
can be triaged separately, using the candidate list produced by `inventory`,
attached to this unit as input.

For each row in `candidates.md`, assign one of:

- **green** — patch bumps, lockfile-only changes, dev-only tools with
  passing tests, or transitive deps with no API surface change.
- **yellow** — minor bumps, anything that touches a build pipeline, or
  packages with a non-trivial changelog.
- **red** — major bumps, anything in audit with `high` or `critical`
  severity, packages whose changelog mentions breaking changes or runtime
  behaviour changes, and anything with fewer than two weeks since release.

Write `classified.md` with three sections (`green`, `yellow`, `red`) and a
one-line justification per package. If a package's changelog cannot be
located, default it to `yellow` and record the gap.

### gate

- Every candidate has exactly one band assigned.
- Each classification has a one-line justification (changelog, severity, age).
- Packages with missing changelog provenance are not silently promoted to
  `green`.

## land-green

Apply the safe upgrades and prove they did not regress, using the
classification produced by `classify`, attached to this unit as input.

1. Apply only the green-band upgrades. Stay under the `max_pr_size`
   parameter; if there are more, split into multiple PRs by domain
   (testing tools, types, runtime, etc.).
2. Run the project's verification gates and save outputs:

   ```sh
   bunx biome check --write src/ tests/
   bunx tsc --noEmit
   bun test
   ```

3. Commit with the convention `chore(deps): bump <list>` and push the
   branch. Open a PR titled `chore(deps): weekly green-band audit <run-id>`
   whose body links to `classified.md` and lists every package bumped with
   `current → new`.
4. If any gate fails, do not push a partially working batch. Bisect the
   failing package, demote it from `green` to `yellow` with a note, and
   retry.

### gate

- A PR exists for the green band, gates passing, body linking to
  `classified.md`.
- No green-band package is shipped without a clean lint, typecheck, and
  test run.
- Demotions from green to yellow are recorded with the failing evidence.

## queue-review

The point of this workflow is to *not* try to land the hard cases on a
schedule. Hand them off cleanly instead, using the results of `land-green`,
attached to this unit as input.

1. For each yellow-band package, file a follow-up issue with:
   - the version delta and changelog link
   - the test surfaces likely to be affected
   - a one-paragraph upgrade plan
2. For each red-band package, file an issue tagged `dep-upgrade` and
   `needs-design` linking to the changelog and to any audit advisory. Do
   *not* attempt the upgrade in this run.
3. Update `handoff.md` listing every issue filed, the green-band PR link,
   and any package that was deferred without an issue (with reason).

### gate

- Every yellow and red package is either in a filed issue or explicitly
  deferred with a reason in `handoff.md`.
- The green-band PR is linked from `handoff.md`.
- No "I'll do it next week" items are left in the workflow run notes
  without a corresponding tracked issue.
