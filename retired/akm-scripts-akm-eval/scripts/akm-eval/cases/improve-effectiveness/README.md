# Improve Effectiveness

`improve-effectiveness` is a deterministic, non-ceiling twin suite. Its representative flaw is a duplicate derived memory: control retrieves both copies, while current improve's high-confidence memory cleanup archives the duplicate and keeps the canonical copy. A separate unrelated anchor protects retrieval health. The suite does not use LLM judging.

## Expected scores

Both cases are deterministic retrieval cases with equal weight inside the retrieval bucket:

- Frozen control: `target-retrieval-lift=0.3`, `protected-anchor-retrieval=1`, overall/deterministic `0.65`.
- Expected treatment: both cases score `1`, overall/deterministic `1.0`.
- Expected lift: `+0.35`; the recommended predeclared minimum is `+0.30`.

The target case reserves `0.3` for preserving the canonical memory and `0.7` for removing the redundant result. The tagged protected case gates index/search health, exact anchor retrieval, and exclusion of both recovery memories from an unrelated query. Neither case has state-dependent skip requirements, so both arms have identical skip eligibility. Any arm-only skip is already made inconclusive by `akm-eval-twin`.

## Seed and freeze

Run from the repository root. Use an isolated installation; do not add these fixtures to a real stash. Set `LLM_ENDPOINT` and `LLM_MODEL` to the same serving identity described by the endpoint metadata used for the twin run.

```sh
export SUITE_DIR="$PWD/scripts/akm-eval/cases/improve-effectiveness"
export BENCH_ROOT="$HOME/.cache/akm-eval/improve-effectiveness"

The preflight score must be `0.65`, both derived files must still be live, and the parent feedback must be less than 30 days old. Refresh the feedback and recapture rather than reusing a stale snapshot. The event uses a durable bundle-qualified ref, so it remains eligible after snapshot relocation; unlike proposal rows, it does not depend on an absolute `stash_dir`.

The duplicate pair has the same provenance and the same content except that the copy's body starts with a lowercase letter. Improve's duplicate fingerprint ignores case, so it still sees one memory twice; search does not, so control still retrieves both. (Search returns entries with identical indexed content once, so a byte-identical copy would no longer be retrieved and the suite would measure no lift.) Improve's deterministic cleanup selects `memories/database-restore.derived` as survivor and archives `memories/database-restore-copy.derived` during the live run. The recent parent feedback plus `memory --require-feedback-signal --limit 1` also sends the parent through the configured reflect/distill LLM path, making treatment LLM telemetry and identity mandatory for a conclusive twin result.

## Recommended twin command

Create the mode-0600 endpoint metadata/runtime files described in `scripts/akm-eval/README.md`, then run:

```sh
scripts/akm-eval/bin/akm-eval-twin \
  --snapshot "$SNAPSHOT" \
  --suite improve-effectiveness \
  --akm "bun $PWD/src/cli.ts" \
  --out "$HOME/.cache/akm-eval/results" \
  --samples 2 --required-samples 2 \
  --policy current \
  --improve-args "memory --strategy reflect-distill --require-feedback-signal --limit 1 --task Add the missing PostgreSQL point-in-time recovery, WAL archive, and checksum procedure" \
  --endpoint-metadata "$ENDPOINT_METADATA" \
  --endpoint-assignment "$ENDPOINT_ID" \
  --endpoint-runtime "$ENDPOINT_RUNTIME" \
  --minimum-deterministic-lift 0.30 \
  --protected-loss-margin 0 \
  --max-treatment-tokens 200000 \
  --max-treatment-calls 20 \
  --max-treatment-duration-ms 1200000 \
  --command-timeout-ms 1200000
```

The suite's protected tag is discovered automatically. A passing experiment means mean deterministic lift met `0.30`, the protected anchor had no loss, all samples were conclusive, treatment LLM identity/telemetry were complete, and the aggregate treatment resource budgets were respected.

## Limitations

- The scored lift is the deterministic duplicate-cleanup outcome. The same treatment run's LLM-generated proposals are queued for later review and are not credited immediately.
- Exact results require the isolated fixture corpus, keyword search (`semanticSearchMode: off`), fresh parent feedback, and the documented strategy arguments.
- This measures one representative retrieval-duplication failure, not broad content quality or downstream task success.
